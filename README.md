# SmartWeather üå¶Ô∏è

SmartWeather is a microservices-based weather data acquisition system. It is designed to collect, process, and display weather data without relying on any existing weather stations. Instead, it integrates its own custom-built acquisition modules, a robust backend, and an interactive web interface.

## Overview üìù

SmartWeather is built as a **monorepo** with multiple layers to handle data acquisition, processing, storage, and presentation. The application supports **containerization** using Docker Compose.Kubernetes orchestration will maybe appear in the future but not immediatly.

Key Features:
- **Embedded Systems Support**: C++ code runs on ESP32 microcontrollers for data acquisition.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each layer is modular to enable scaling and features additions.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Kafka and MQTT enable seamless streaming and communication.
- **Flexible Storage Solutions**: MySQL clusters for structured data and Elasticsearch for document-oriented data.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Kibana, Kafka-ui and a web client for monitoring and administration.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Most of SmartWeather services adopts an **n-tier architecture** with the following layers, for C# apps you will find theses layers in the [/libs](./libs/README.md) folder:

1. **Entities** - Definition for the base entities that will structure application logic.
2. **Repositories** - Persistence layer interface to abstract from databases implementation.
3. **Services** - Main entrypoint for app integration, provides main functionalities to again abstract from repositories handling.

Each layer represent a library, it also exist for C++ application but it is not currently delocalized in the [/libs](./libs/README.md) folder.

## Quick Start üöÄ

SmartWeather.Project is made to be ultra portable, regardless of the complexity the project embded. Basically you will only need docker to run it, and a single command. If it's not the case, don't hesitate to open an Issue.

### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
- **.NET SDK** and **Node.js** (for development).

### Deployment ‚ö°
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SmartWeather.git
cd SmartWeather.Project

# Start the entire application
docker compose -f ./app.yml up -d
```

### Accessing Services üåê
- Web Client: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Kafka UI: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
